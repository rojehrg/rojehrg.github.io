					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about how important padding and whitespace is. The reason is for many things like consistency visually, and making the
							consumer be able <br> to enjoy the website without losing focus. It also increases readability. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part is when they highlighted the struggles between engineers and designers. An issue that worried me is that what if all my
								requests are too nitpicky and such. But as shown in the article, things such as white space and <br> padding make it very important to have an accessible
							and readable website. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Users will scroll and scroll some more. I promise you. There is this myth that users will not always scroll to see all the content on a page. Thus, some of our stakeholders request that the majority of a pageâ€™s content lives above the fold." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>

							<p> 10, very informative and useful. </p>
