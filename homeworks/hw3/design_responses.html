							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Typography is important when it comes to webdesign and describing and relaying information onto the user. If you are
								designing a landing page, you would want a simple font that would not distract the user from images. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part about this article is when they explained the special cases and scenarios where a certain font would be better suited for a webpage
								rather than another. I like the image examples they provided because I needed it. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When choosing type, take into account your audience and their needs. Simply put, empathize with your users." </p>
						</li>
