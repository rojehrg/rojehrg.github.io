        Hello! My name is Rojeh Hosny, I enjoy walking around Berkeley, and visitng all the neighboring cities. Last year, I visited many libraries
        and coffee shops around. In my freetime, I like to play videogames, and listen to music.<br> They help when I am very stressed during exams and such. 
        Below, I have listed 3 of my favorite reastauirants that I frequented plent y of times ever since I came to Berkeley.

    </ul>

        <li>I learned about heirarchy, and why is it such an important but usually overlooked aspect of design.<br> It usually involves how some information from the website
            is either highlighted, or helps indicate the user to where they want to be directed.
        </li>
        <li>My favorite part about the article was the use of GIFs to introduce certain topics. This is especially important because with topics like design,
             you want <br> to be able to see the process from start to finish.</li>
        <li>"As you watch each component build upon the next, be curious about everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made for this product."</li>
        <li>10, this is a short and simple article about basics of designs, that are simple but usally overlooked.</li>
